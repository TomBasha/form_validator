README

form-validator is a mock, client side-only HTML, CSS and (vanilla) JavaScript registration form with simple validations for various user-input fields.

FEATURES

The form validates whether the fields (below) meet certain characteristics. It alerts users, using CSS styling, whether they have or have not filled out the fields correctly and provides helpful messages on how to address any erroneous values.

Username (min/max length requirements)
Email address (email naming convention adherence)
Passwords (match or not)

NOTES

The app was built while coding along with “20 Web Projects With Vanilla JavaScript”, and so many thanks to the author of the course, Brad Traversy (bradtraversy).
